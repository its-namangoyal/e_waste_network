This project is a Django-based application where users can post their used electronic waste for sale. It functions similarly to an e-commerce site but is specifically designed for electronic waste items. The main features of the platform include:

1. User Posting: Users can create listings for electronic waste, including details like the product name, description, price, and images. The posting form is user-friendly, allowing easy submission of details.

2. Product Management: Users can manage their listings by editing or deleting them. This gives them full control over the items they want to sell.

3. E-Waste Focus: Unlike a general e-commerce site, this platform is dedicated solely to electronic waste, promoting recycling and responsible disposal of old gadgets and electronic items.

4. Responsive Design: The site is designed to work smoothly across various devices, providing a consistent user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

5. Django Framework: Using Django allows for robust handling of user authentication, session management, and database interactions, ensuring smooth operation and scalability.

This project could serve as a niche platform for sustainable e-commerce, encouraging the resale and responsible handling of electronic waste.
